Which can result in unnecessary lateness or tardiness to events and classes on campus.</p>

                                        <p class="modal-b" style="display: inline;">Through the use of newly installed parking lot cameras with image detection software, and a new mobile parking application for Western Washington University, these problems can be alleviated. <b>The proposed technology relies upon cameras that track available parking lot spaces </b> and also provide users with a live feed of parking lots. Giving them a better visual indicator, along with metric data, of how crowded certain lots ares. <b>The mobile parking application gives users a live camera feed and number of available parking spaces for each parking lot on campus </b>. These parking lots are sorted between student, guest, and faculty parking, so <b>the experience is tailored</b> to each of these user groups.</p>

                                    <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;" class="top-buffer">The first option for navigation is to look at parking availability across lots on WWU's campus. These parking lots are sorted into student, faculty, and guest parking, the three user groups for the application. By default, student parking is shown first. Each relevant parking lot for the current user group is shown as a "card" with information on the current lot, including live camera feeds. Users have the ability to star lots, which will then show up first in the list of parking lots, allowing users to easily access their preferred lots faster. Furthermore, users can select "park now" which will pull up the relevant lot information in Park Mobile. The university currently uses Park Mobile as their pay-to-park application. So, our application allows users to seamlessly check availability, and then park on demand. This reduces the overhead work that WWU would need to put forth in order to develop the application. </p>

Parking lots are sorted by student, guest, and faculty parking. Lots not available for the current user group are grayed out, while those that are available, can be clicked on to show more information, such as name, lot size, and designation. Selecting a lot also allows a user to elect to "park now" which pulls up the relevant parking information in Park Mobile (further discussed in the above section).</p>

                                    <p class="modal-c">Our client wanted to have an interactive web application for hosting a collection of interviews with various individuals, reflecting on the impact of the pandemic. Additionally, the client wanted the ability to add new interviews to the collection and edit existing information by authorized users. Allowing for people outside of the project to interact with the audio collection but not change any internal information. Eventually, the client hoped that this project would expand to host other types of audio collections like museum databases.</p> <br>
                                    <p style="margin-bottom: 45px;" class="modal-c">Our group achieved this by creating a website that allows authorized users to log in, upload their own audio entries, and fill in the corresponding metadata describing the file. The files metadata includes different information like the track name, speaker’s name, themes, as well as a description of what was said during the track. To add intractability, as users listen through the main playlist, they are given the option to choose different branching points of audio, like choosing your own adventure. This spawns the chosen playlist into the main playlist. Additionally, users can move away from the main playlist, and listen to other playlists of audio, which are grouped together by themes, like coping, which tells the story of how different people coped during the pandemic.</p>

As our project spanned a full year of development, each new academic quarter brought an opportunity to reiterate the design. Our team worked using Agile flow, allowing for iterative development of our application across quarters. Each quarter, I would receive feedback on my design from my project teammates and our client and then use this feedback to fuel a new and improved version of the design. The full functionality of our final project is demonstrated in the video below. </p>

I was responsible for creating the initial design mockups for the home screen and the logging screens. My initial designs were created using Canva and placed an emphasis on proving the user with their data and pushing them to improve their habits by supplying them with tips and goals.

                                    <p class="modal-c">Creating a strong and memorable password is a crucial challenge for many people.  Highly secure passwords are often difficult to remember, which can lead individuals to use less secure but more easily remembered options. This compromise increases the risk of unauthorized access to personal and sensitive information. Our project addresses this issue by developing a passphrase generator designed to balance security and memorability. </p> <br>
                                    <p class="modal-c">The findings from our survey of students at Western Washington University show that a majority of the participants, have difficulty remembering their passwords or have trouble logging in to their accounts. The majority of users also prefer the memorablity of their passphrases, even at the expense of its security. Which is why they also favor memorable passphrases over highly secure random strings. This highlights the need for a tool that can help people create, remember, and store secure passwords easily. </p>

                                    <p class="modal-b" style="display: inline;">Through the use of newly installed parking lot cameras with image detection software, and a new mobile parking application for Western Washington University, these problems can be alleviated. <b>The proposed technology relies upon cameras that track available parking lot spaces </b> and also provide users with a live feed of parking lots. Giving them a better visual indicator, along with metric data, of how crowded certain lots ares. <b>The mobile parking application gives users a live camera feed and number of available parking spaces for each parking lot on campus </b>. These parking lots are sorted between student, guest, and faculty parking, so <b>the experience is tailored</b> to each of these user groups.</p>

                                <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;" class="top-buffer">The design was created initially using a wireframe to develop a low-fidelity mockup of the necessary features, pages, navigation, and components for the next design iteration. In this wireframe, the homepage, parking, and map pages were planned out, creating a flow between the main homepage and to the subpages of the system. The notice page was created later, after the inital wireframes. </p>

After some research of their websites and designs, I identified specific colors (light green, blues, white) and fonts (montserrat, Fira Sans) for use in the application. </p>

                                <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;" class="top-buffer">The first option for navigation is to look at parking availability across lots on WWU's campus. These parking lots are sorted into student, faculty, and guest parking, the three user groups for the application. By default, student parking is shown first. Each relevant parking lot for the current user group is shown as a "card" with information on the current lot, including live camera feeds. Users have the ability to star lots, which will then show up first in the list of parking lots, allowing users to easily access their preferred lots faster. Furthermore, users can select "park now" which will pull up the relevant lot information in Park Mobile. The university currently uses Park Mobile as their pay-to-park application. So, our application allows users to seamlessly check availability, and then park on demand. This reduces the overhead work that WWU would need to put forth in order to develop the application. </p>

Giving users a better sense of where unfamiliar lots are located, especially for those who are new to campus or visitors.  Users can use their fingers to pinch and scroll through the map. Parking lots are sorted by student, guest, and faculty parking. Lots not available for the current user group are grayed out, while those that are available, can be clicked on to show more information, such as name, lot size, and designation. Selecting a lot also allows a user to elect to "park now" which pulls up the relevant parking information in Park Mobile (further discussed in the above section).</p>
